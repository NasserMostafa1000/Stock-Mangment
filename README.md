📦 Inventory & Sales Management System
🛠 Overview
This is a self-contained desktop application developed entirely by me using the .NET Framework. The system is built with an embedded SQLite database, meaning no external server or database installation is required—everything is included within the app for easy deployment and smooth performance.

⚠️ Important Notice
This application is completely free and available for anyone to use.

However, please note that this is one of my early software projects. There is a known design flaw in the database schema: invoices (which contain multiple products per order) are handled via two separate tables, rather than a more optimal relational design. This has made the system unnecessarily complex.

Despite this, the application is fully functional and can serve as a helpful tool for small businesses.
